# 🎮 The Autonomous Game Studio Showcase

## Welcome to the Future of Game Development
All games in this repository were built **100% using AI Agentic Workflows**.
- **0% Manual Coding**
- **100% Logic by Gemini 3 Pro**
- **100% Graphics by Nano Banana Pro**

## Why does this exist?
This project demonstrates the methodology taught in the "Autonomous Game Studio" course. We believe the future belongs to architects who orchestrate AI, not just those who battle syntax.
